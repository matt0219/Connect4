# Connect 4 Game

## Your challenge is to build out this Connect Four game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the game rules
2. Play a game of Connect Four against another human player (alternating turns on the same computer)
3. View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
4. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
5. Bonus: See the discs animate into their position when a move is made
6. Bonus: Play against the computer


Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
